// Create a cache to store the code exported from each module.
// Each module should be stored as an object with a property 'exports'.



// Create a function that will allow you to import code from one file into another.
// You should use 'fs' and 'vm' methods to load the file's text and run it as JS code.
// The function should take a filepath as an argument and return that file's exports.



// Use the loading function you created to load and run 'server.js'.
